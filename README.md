switch block
loops(for,while)
continue and break

Like function in c we have a method in java

C will support pass by value and pass by reference

But our java will only support pass by value there is no concept of pass by refrence

if you want to iterate numbers from 1 to 10
i=1;i<=10;i++
for(intialization;condtion;increment/decrement)
while(condition)
//todo
write a program to find factorial of a number

//todo
write a program to verify the given number is prime number

if the number is facing factor count =2

write a program to find the factors for a given numbers

usage of nested for loop
*
**
***


write a program to reverse a number
545
543

3*1+4*10+5*100
345

syntax for swich block

switch(type){
case "ADD":
a+b;
break;

case "DIV":
b/a;
break;
default 
break;
}

//equilateral triangle
//fibonacci series


//java can have pass by refrence

1.what is a method
what are the advantages of method

2.Namning convetions are required to create a method

3.Types of a method

User defined method
Predefined method

static method
non static method

method overloading

//constructor
